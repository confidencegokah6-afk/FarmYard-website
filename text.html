        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
          FarmYard’s mission is to connect local farmers directly to urban consumers via a seamless mobile app,
          delivering clean, healthy and affordable fresh produce straight to your doorsteps. By leveraging
          technology, ethical sourcing and efficient logistics, we bridge the gap between rural agriculture and
          urban demand, fostering food security, supporting farmers and inspiring healthier lifestyles across Ghana.
        </p>

        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Our vision is to transform Ghana’s food ecosystem by making farm-fresh, nutritious and affordable food
          accessible to every household — empowering communities to thrive through health, sustainability,
          efficient supply chains and quality assurance.

      <section id="returns">
        <h2>Return &amp; Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>
          At FarmYard we are committed to delivering the freshest, highest-quality farm produce to your doorstep.
          Due to the perishable nature of our products, our return and refund policy differs from typical retail policies.
        </p>

        <p>We guarantee that all produce delivered meets our quality standards at the time of delivery. If you receive
          products that do not meet these standards, we will work with you to make it right. All products are subject
          to seasonal availability and farm production capacity. We reserve the right to substitute similar products when
          specific items become unavailable.</p>

        <h3>1. Return Eligibility</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Returns are only accepted for spoiled or wrong items received.</li>
          <li>Only non-perishable items (e.g. packaged goods, merchandise) may be eligible for return.</li>
          <li>Perishable items (fresh fruits, vegetables, herbs) are not returnable once delivered.</li>
          <li>Customers must notify us within <strong>24 hours</strong> of delivery.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Proof of Issue</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We require a photo or video of the product to verify spoilage or error.</li>
          <li>Our team will assess whether the issue qualifies for a refund or replacement.</li>
          <li>Eligible issues will be handled by refund or replacement subject to stock availability, or store credit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Refund or Replacement</h3>
        <p>Refunds may be partial or full depending on damage severity and circumstances.</p>

        <h3>4. Non-Returnable Items</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Produce that has been partially consumed, mishandled, or stored improperly after delivery.</li>
          <li>All perishables (e.g., tomato, onion, okra, garden eggs, lettuce, cabbage, pepper) are final sale due to their nature.</li>
          <li>Items reported after the 24-hour window are not eligible.</li>
        </ul>
